Before running it in VM make sure you build linux kernal first. Then You should download BusyBox and build it too. Afterwards make a ext4 fs named rootfs.img and make a folder rootfs and mount it on rootfs.img after that make a folders like any other linux based OS /etc /sbin ... and many more. after copy init inside rootfs/sbin/. and also BusyBox inside bin. and if you don't know how to copy BusyBox search online you'll find it with ease. after all of this don't forget to unmount rootfs.

now you are good to go, run this inside VM.

Thank You!
